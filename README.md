# Hi, I'm Andrew Anca

I was introduced to programming through conversation and took my first programming course at the British Columbia Institute of Technology. Since then I have been very interested in creating command line applications in Python and Java.

I am currently on the look out for a role in web development, ideally writing JavaScript or TypeScript. I would love to work at an interesting startup or large tech company where my code can make an impact.

- 🖥 I've been coding in Python for over 2 years
- ⌨️ I’m currently learning C++
- 🎮 I’m looking to collaborate on apps & games
- 🌍 I’m interested in computing & software development
